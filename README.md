## Machine Learning

### Overview
Machine learning is a set of techniques that allow machines to learn from data and experience, rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behavior by hand. Over the past two decades, machine learning techniques have become increasingly central both in AI as an academic field, and in the technology industry. This course provides a broad introduction to some of the most commonly used ML algorithms.

The first half of the course focuses on supervised learning. We begin with nearest neighbours, decision trees, and ensembles. Then we introduce parametric models, including linear regression, logistic and softmax regression, and neural networks. We then move on to unsupervised learning, focusing in particular on probabilistic models, but also principal components analysis and K-means. Finally, we cover the basics of reinforcement learning.

### Where and When

There is a single section of the course. Tutorials will be held in the main lecture room.
